# JavaScript-Challenge
## JavaScript & DOM Manipulation

In this project, javascript was used to build two different UFO levels (levels 1 & 2).
### Level 1: Automatic Table & Date Search
Created a basic HTML web page

Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.

#### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

	date/time
	
	city
	
	state
	
	country
	
	shape
